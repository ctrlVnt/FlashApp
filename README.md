## How does it work?

### Collection creation

In the main screen there is the button to add the new collection.
*Attention: deck information cannot currently be changed.*

### Tag

The tag information is free text which at the moment its creation will not affect the operation of the application.
Tag works even as a description.

### Collection

At the bottom right there is the button to add new cards, you can only upload images in the application.
Blank cards cannot be added.

### Play

Press "Jouer" and enjoy!

Look at the question, press "tourner" when you think you know the answer and indicate whether you did it right or not.
When you run out of cards you will see your result.
